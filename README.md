SampleGames is, in this order,:
P1 wins
P2 wins
Game is tied
P1 wins in one move (P2's turn)
P1 wins in two moves (P1's turn)
P1 wins in six moves (P2's turn, but branching factor of 1)
P2 wins (P2's turn)

The new .txt files beside SampleGames are each a game. The title of each file shows how complex it is and who should win, while the turn in the file is just who's turn it is in that game state.
